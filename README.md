#       Ticks
## We are reporting the largest species diversity of ticks infestation in Nigeria
I and Dr Omoregie from the University of Benin, Nigeria, are investigating tick prevalence on cattles at a trade market in Benin City.  Tick data is collected from Six (6) predilection sites of cattles: Head, Shoulders, Belly, Legs, Tail and Neck.
**Whats new?**
1. We are investigating ticks --For the first time-- at community level.
2. We are having the <u> largest species diverstiy of ticks ever reported in studies from Nigeria (and probably West Africa)
3. We are using Unsupervised clustering methods (K means, K-Mediods) to try to match cattles to where they are imported from using the tick communities present on them as indicators.

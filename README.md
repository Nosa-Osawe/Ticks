# Ticks

I and Dr Omoregie from the University of Benin, Nigeria, are investigating tick prevalence on cattles at a trade market in Benin City. 
Whats new? We are investigating at community level. Tick data is collected from Six (6) predilection sites of cattles: Head, Shoulders, Belly, Legs, Tail and Neck.
